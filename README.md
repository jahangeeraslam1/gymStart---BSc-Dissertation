## Project Description 
For my 4th year dissertation project, I decided to research, design and implement my own IOS app in Swift. The fundemental idea was that this app woukld provide new gym users with everything they need to get started in the gym. The app has a Learn section which edcuates users on key exercises, a Log section which allows users to store thier workout infromation (sets/reps) into a backend database and a dashboard to allow the data gather to be presetned to the user in an interactive dynamic format. It also provides each user with a dailt top tip tilored to thier fitness goal.


## Instructions
This file will provide you with everything you need to run this project.

**WARNING : The only IDE to run swift files which I am aware of is Xcode hence this file will detail how to run this project using the Xcode IDE. If another IDE is wished to be used it is up to the individual to figure out how to run this project using their method.**


## Step 1

Install the latest version of Xcode onto your machine from: 
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

Note: This currently only available to do on MacOS.

## Step 2

Once Xcode is installed fully, open terminal.
Run the following command to install the CocoPods package dependency manager to your computer. 

...................
sudo gem install cocoa-pods
................

Note : "This must be done or certain aspects of the project will fail to build later"


## Step 3

Once CocoPods has been fully installed, extract the JahangeerAslam_fourth_year_project.zip file.
Navigate to where you extracted these files in the terminal and cd into the extracted folder.
Run the following command in the project directory, from the terminal.

.............
pod update
...........

The pods required from the project should then successfully install from the PodFile and should be highlighted as green in the terminal once completed.

## Step 4

Open the .xcworkspace file from the project source code in Xcode. ( DO NOT run the .xcodeproj file, this is a common mistake some people make :) )

## Step 5

Change the development device(located beside the run button in Xcode IDE) to iPhone 8 Plus and click the Run button.
The project should be begin building and run once completed. If this is the first time you are running the project please be patient as it will take some time. One the project has been built once, it will run very quickly in future.

An IOS simulator should then appear with the app running on your computer!
You should have now successfully launched the project.
Enjoy!
